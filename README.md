## ⚠️ Requirements
- Game that natively supports DLSS Upscaling and DLSS Frame Generation
- For Multi-Frame Generation to be enabled in the game's graphics settings, it must natively support the feature

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Frame Generation (MFG) & XeFG:** Out of the box, DLSS Unlocked primarily targets GeForce RTX 20 and 30 series GPUs (Turing & Ampere) via the native `dlssg_sm86` unlocker. RTX 40 series (Ada Lovelace) users can easily switch to the Ada MFG unlocker (`AdaMfgUnlock`) directly via the OptiScaler in-game overlay or `OptiScaler.ini`. Intel Xe Frame Generation (XeFG) is also supported via the bundled native XeMFG unlocker. DLSS Enabler headless is also bundled as an alternative companion option.
- **DLSS-G Frame Generation Bridge:** Seamlessly translates NVIDIA Streamline DLSS-G calls to native DLSS Frame Generation, Xe Frame Generation, or AMD FidelityFX FSR 3.1 Frame Generation via OptiScaler.
- **Neural Rendering (DLSS-NR & Pre-SR Multipass):** Full support for my OptiScaler-DLSSNR-PreSR-Multipass backend (based on wilsjo2), preserving native SM75/SM86 MFG unlocking, pre-SR multipass neural rendering, improved DLSS 5 compatibility, and forwarder.
- **Linux / Proton Support:** Clean modular layout without recursive driver deadlocks.
- **Dual Release Format:** All-in-one automated Setup installer (`.exe`) and clean standalone manual archive (`.zip`).

## 📦 Download & Installation

Get the latest release from the **[Releases](../../releases)** page.

### Option A: Automated Installer (`.exe`) — Recommended for Windows
1. Download `dlss-unlocked-setup-*.exe`.
2. Run the installer and browse to your game's executable directory (e.g. `C:\Games\YourGame\bin\x64`).
3. Complete the installation wizard.

### Option B: Standalone Package (`.zip`) — Recommended for Linux / Manual Installs
1. Download `dlss-unlocked-standalone-*.zip`.
2. Extract the contents directly into your game's executable folder alongside the main game `.exe`:
   - **Root folder:** `dxgi.dll` *(rename to `version.dll` if using ReShade)*, `OptiScaler.ini`, `nvngx.dll_dlssnr.dll`, `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` (patched DLSS-NR)
   - **`OptiScaler/` folder:** Companion modules (`dlss-enabler-headless.dll`, `nvsmooth30.dll`, `dlssg_to_fsr3_amd_is_better.dll`, `nvngx.ini`, FidelityFX, XeSS, registry bypasses)
   - **`OptiScaler/dlssg_sm86/` folder:** Native Turing/Ampere MFG unlocker (`dlssg_sm86.dll`, `dlssg_sm86.ini`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`)
   - **`OptiScaler/streamline/` folder:** NVIDIA Streamline 2.14.1 runtime files
   - **`REPatch/` folder:** Patched REFramework (`dinput8.dll`) designed to address XeFG issues and stutters in Capcom / RE Engine titles
   - **`Licenses/` folder:** Official licenses for NVIDIA Streamline, AMD FidelityFX, Intel XeSS, REFramework (MIT), third-party libraries, and legal disclaimers
3. **(Linux / Proton)** Launch the game with the following launch options (required for native DLSS MFG via `dlssg_sm86` in addition to the DLL override):
   ```bash
   WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dxgi=n,b" PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_NVIDIA_NVCUDA=1 %command%
   ```

## 🎮 Supported GPUs

- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20xx / 30xx (Turing & Ampere):** Enabled out of the box with the bundled `dlssg_sm86` native MFG unlocker.
- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40xx (Ada Lovelace):** Fully supported; can switch to the Ada MFG unlocker (`AdaMfgUnlock=true`) or native DLSS FG via the in-game overlay or `OptiScaler.ini`.

## 🚀 Automated CI Builds

This repository automatically tracks and synchronizes with upstream [OptiScaler-DLSSNR-PreSR-Multipass](https://github.com/ShyVortex/OptiScaler-DLSSNR-PreSR-Multipass):
1. Checks for new releases every 3 hours.
2. Packages the latest upscaler binaries, neural rendering forwarders, and companion libraries.
3. Automatically builds and publishes both `.exe` installer and `.zip` standalone manual packages on new releases.

### DLSS-NR Denoise First with display-resolution motion vectors

`OptiScaler-patches/` carries an OptiScaler patch that lets DLSS-NR **Denoise First** run in games that supply display-resolution motion vectors (e.g. Stellar Blade), instead of reporting it as inactive. The **Build patched OptiScaler** workflow builds and tests it. See [`OptiScaler-patches/README.md`](OptiScaler-patches/README.md) for the build, how to drop the resulting `OptiScaler.dll` into a DLSS Unlocked install, and how to verify it in game.

## 🛠️ Building Locally

To build the standalone package or installer locally:

```powershell
# 1. Download latest OptiScaler-DLSSNR-PreSR-Multipass and package standalone zip
.\build-optiscaler.ps1 -DownloadLatest -CreateStandaloneZip

# 2. Compile Inno Setup installer (requires Inno Setup 6.2+)
# Open "DLSS unlocked.iss" in Inno Setup Compiler and click Build
```

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### 1. Overlay Crash on Linux / Proton (DirectX 12)
Some DX12 games may crash (`VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`) under Wine / Proton when opening the OptiScaler in-game overlay menu:
- **Fix:** Set `OverlayMenu=false` under `[Menu]` in `OptiScaler.ini`.
- **Note:** This allows the overlay to render via the game's internal render pipeline without crashing the Vulkan presentation queue, though the menu colors may be affected by the game's auto-exposure or tone-mapping. You can adjust colors or switch to a dark theme under **Menu Theme and Color** in the overlay.

### 2. Resident Evil Requiem & Capcom RE Engine Games
Capcom's RE Engine enforces strict memory and swapchain integrity checks:
- **Crash on Boot (`re9.exe!0x140000000...`):**
  - Use `dxgi.dll` as the proxy name and install **[REFramework](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework)** (`dinput8.dll`) into the game root directory alongside `dxgi.dll`. REFramework safely hooks into the engine early and bypasses Capcom's VTable integrity checks.
- **Intel Xe Frame Generation (XeFG) Issues & Stutters:**
  - Install the patched REFramework build (`dinput8.dll`) by selecting the "Patch REFramework (fixes XeFG issues)" option in the installer or copying `dinput8.dll` from the `REPatch` folder in the standalone ZIP archive into your game root directory alongside `dxgi.dll`.
